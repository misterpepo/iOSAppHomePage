    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: April 30, 2025</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the "Rehabilitation Environment Checklist" ("App") collects, uses, and discloses your information. The App is designed for rehabilitation professionals to assess and document housing environments for patients. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your data.</p>
    
    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The Rehabilitation Environment Checklist app is designed to function entirely offline and locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. All data created within the app is stored locally on your device.</p>
    
    <p>The App may collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Patient Information:</strong> Name, gender, diagnosis, visit date, and other relevant health information that you choose to enter.</li>
        <li><strong>Housing Environment Data:</strong> Measurements, descriptions, and other details about the patient's living environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Images captured within the app or imported from your photo library.</li>
        <li><strong>AR Measurements:</strong> Measurement data captured using your device's AR capabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data you create in the App is stored locally on your device using iOS's secure storage mechanisms. We do not upload, transmit, or back up your data to any external servers or cloud services. You are responsible for backing up your device according to Apple's recommended procedures to prevent data loss.</p>
    
    <h2>Camera and Photo Library Access</h2>
    <p>The App requests access to your device's camera and photo library to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Capture new photos of housing environments</li>
        <li>Import existing photos from your library</li>
        <li>Use AR functionality for measurements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used solely for providing the app's core functionality and no images are transmitted or stored outside your device.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>The App includes functionality to generate and share PDF reports. When you choose to share reports, you determine the recipient and sharing method. We do not have access to or control over the data you choose to share. We recommend exercising caution when sharing reports containing sensitive patient information.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not integrate with any third-party analytics services, advertising networks, or social media platforms. We do not share your data with any third parties.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information you create within the App by relying on iOS's built-in security features for local data storage. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We recommend using device passcodes, Touch ID, or Face ID to secure access to your device.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for use by healthcare professionals and is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at the address provided below.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you maintain complete control over your information. You can delete any or all data from the App at any time by using the deletion features within the App or by uninstalling the App.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Consent</h2>
    <p>By using the App, you consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use our App.</p>
